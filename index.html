I sought feedback from instructors on my writing and implemented their suggestions. I analyzed successful business reports to understand structure and formatting. I practiced presentations multiple times and recorded myself to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I joined a peer review group where we critiqued each other's business documents.</p>
